## Introduction
**Road Watcher** is a project aimed at monitoring and detecting potholes on roads, helping to enhance traffic safety and driving experience. This **Back-End** is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle requests from the Android application (or any client), providing key functionalities such as:
- User management (sign-up, login, password reset, Google OAuth)
- Pothole data operations (create, read, update, delete, statistics, coordinate checks)
- Safe-route navigation (based on pothole data)
- History management
- Downloading `.mbtiles` map files for offline use

---

## Technologies
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Framework for routing and middleware
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database (use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or a local MongoDB instance)
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: For authentication and authorization
- **Passport.js**: For Google OAuth integration 
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management
- **morgan, cors**: Useful middleware for request logging and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

---

## System Requirements
1. **Node.js** >= 14
2. **npm** or **yarn**
3. **MongoDB**:
   - Either a locally installed MongoDB or **MongoDB Atlas** (recommended).
4. A **.env** file to configure environment variables (see [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration)).
